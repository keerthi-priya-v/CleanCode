Reflect on class, function and variable naming conventions on
- StringBuilder or LocalDateTime class

StrinBuilder 
- It is a mutable sequence of characters.
- The class provides no guarantee of synchronization.
- Class names are typed in uppercase and meaningful.
- Variables and function names are typed in a camel case.

LocalDateTime
- To display date and time
- It is final class and no extension of the class is allowed
- Class names are typed in uppercase and meaningful.
- Variables and function names are typed in a camel case.

These conventions have become apart of Java that all the programmers should follow.
